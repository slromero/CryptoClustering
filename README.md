## CryptoClustering
Assignment 19 Unsupervised Learning

In the unsupervised learning models, we calculate the optimum value for Kmeans, and then run the model in each case for the corresponding number of clusters.  After modeling the original data, we attempt to optimize Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to check for a similar result using a simplified dataset.  If the PCA model yields a similar result to the original, it represents a more efficent method to achieve a good result.

The X and Y values are transformed, so you are only looking at the clustering result when comparing the two models.
